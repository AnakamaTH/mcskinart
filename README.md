##  Features

## How to Use

## 1. Select a Picture for Your Skinart

Your image will be resized to **72×24 pixels** (a 9×3 grid of 8×8 tiles).  
Each tile becomes a separate head layer for your Minecraft skin.

> **Important**: Avoid using the **first 8×8 tile (top-left)** — it overlaps your main skin’s head.

**Example:**

![art](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/406f21ba-7908-4795-9d0a-eea0bfb7e65e)

### 2. Upload skin

Use the website to upload your **base skin** and **skinart image** directly.
