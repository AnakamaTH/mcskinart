### 1. Select a Picture for Your SkinArt

Your image will be resized to **72√ó24 pixels** (a 9√ó3 grid of 8√ó8 tiles).  
Each tile becomes a separate head layer for your Minecraft skin.

> **Important**: Avoid using the **first 8√ó8 tile (top-left)** ‚Äî it overlaps your main skin‚Äôs head.

**Example:**

If it‚Äôs not **72√ó24**, it will be resized automatically.
