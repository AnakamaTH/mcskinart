# NameMC SkinArt Generator

# Features
- Fast
- Automatic image resizer
- Allows using a custom skin.png as a template


# How to use

**1) Select a picture as your skinart**
Your image will be resized to a 72x24 pixel image
The first 8x8 pixels will be saved as skin_27.png but its better not to use the first 8x8 pixels since it covers your normal skin.

**Example**:


![art](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/406f21ba-7908-4795-9d0a-eea0bfb7e65e)



## Web
**2) Use the website to upload your base skin and skinart.**

## Windows
**2) Run the app and select your map image (72x24, if bigger or smaller it will be resized), also add a skin.png if you want**

**Final**
- Equip all skins from skin 1 to skin 26

- Don't equip the next skin until you see the current one in NameMC.
