# How to use
**1) Select a picture as your skinart**
Your image will be resized to a 72x24 pixel image
The first 8x8 pixels will be saved as skin_27.png but its better not to use the first 8x8 pixels since it covers your normal skin.

**Example**:
![skinart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8818cd8c-d9cd-4dab-983a-9536e16b03ba)
