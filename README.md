# NameMC SkinArt Generator


# Features
- Fast
- Automatic image resizer
- Allows using a custom skin.png as a template

# Usage
- Equip all skins from skin 1 to skin 26
- Use the [Minecraft Website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editskin) while equiping skins. (NOT THE LAUNCHER)
- Don't equip the next skin until you see the current one in NameMC.
  

# How to use
**1) Select a picture as your skinart**
Your image will be resized to a 72x24 pixel image
The first 8x8 pixels will be saved as skin_27.png but its better not to use the first 8x8 pixels since it covers your normal skin.

**Example**:
