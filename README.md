##  Features

---

## How to Use
- [For Web Version](#2-web-version)
- [For Windows Version](#3-windows-version)

## 1. Select a Picture for Your Skinart

Your image will be resized to **72×24 pixels** (a 9×3 grid of 8×8 tiles).  
Each tile becomes a separate head layer for your Minecraft skin.

> **Important**: Avoid using the **first 8×8 tile (top-left)** — it overlaps your main skin’s head.

**Example:**

## 3. Windows Version

Run the Windows app and select your `map.png` image (your art).  
If it’s not **72×24**, it will be resized automatically.

Add a custom `skin.png` to use as the base.
